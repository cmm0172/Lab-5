Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study?
	Right now, I do not do any type of document or code management other than this class. This means that I do not handle publishable work. However, if I did, I know that I would not have nearly the knowledge that I have now to make sure I am making comments and saving my code in multiple places such as GitHub, as well as possibly publishing my work for others to examine. 
	In terms of this Lab, I do not think that our code would stand to a reproducibility test, mostly because our code is messy and filled with commented-out lines and lines that likely do not make sense. If we were an actual research group, we would not work very well with long lines of code if we handled the research code like we did with this short code. In the real world, this would cause our code to be non-reproducible, which would affect our credibility, as no one would be able to double check that our work produced accurate and reliable results. This is the same as if someone had just made up numbers for a research paper then published it. I think this applies to both computational biology, bioinformatics, and genetics. Lack of proper documentation hinders overall reliability.
